# üö® Anti FiveHub: Protect Your FiveM Server üö®

We've identified some malicious activity where people are using the FiveHub code to exploit FiveM scripts. To help you prevent abuse and protect your system, follow these steps.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning:** If you get kicked from your FiveM server and see a message saying it‚Äôs locked or blocked, instructing you to join a Discord server for more information, **do NOT do it!** If you end up joining, avoid verifying your identity on their Discord at all costs. Stay safe.

## Steps to Remove Malicious Resources from Your FiveM Server

### 1. Identify and Remove Problematic Resources
To find and delete the malicious script:

- Open your `resources` folder.
- Right-click on the folder and select **"Open with Code"** (using VSCode).
- Use the search function to look for `PerformHttpRequest`.
  - Check for any lines of code similar to this:  
    `https://fivehub-panel.site/api.php?key=`
- Once identified, **remove** the script that uses this URL.
- Delete the resource called **sessionmanager** and download a clean version from this link:  
  [Download New SessionManager](https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data)

### 2. Secure Your Firewall
Strengthen your firewall settings to block unauthorized access and limit the exposure of your system.

#### Whitelist Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
To protect your server‚Äôs RDP access:

- Open your **Firewall** settings.
- Navigate to **Inbound Rules**.
- Look for **"Remote Desktop - User Mode (TCP-In)"**.
- Click on **"Scope"** or **"Ranges"**.
- Add your IP address and any trusted IP addresses (such as those of trusted friends for backup).
- Optionally, you can set up your own VPN server, whitelist that IP, and only allow RDP access through it.

#### Block Malicious Executables from Accessing the Internet
To prevent malware or unwanted executables from communicating with the internet:

- Go to your **Firewall** settings.
- Navigate to **Inbound Rules**.
- Create a new rule for the program located at:  
  `C:/Desktop/Microstub.exe`
- Block its internet access.

### 3. Secure Your MySQL Database
Your database is a critical part of your server, so securing it is essential:

- Always use **strong passwords** for your MySQL users.
- Ensure that the **root user** has access **only locally** (i.e., on the server itself) and not remotely.

### 4. Change Your RDP Password
It‚Äôs good practice to regularly change your server‚Äôs **Administrator password**. If you suspect any suspicious activity, change your password immediately to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

## 5. Modify Your `hosts` File to Block Malicious Sites
To further protect your system, you should add the following entries to your `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file. This will block access to malicious domains:

```
127.0.0.1 cipher-panel.me 
127.0.0.1 ciphercheats.com
127.0.0.1 keyx.club
127.0.0.1 dark-utilities.xyz

127.0.0.1 fivehub.xyz
127.0.0.1 fivehub-panel.site
```

### How to Edit the Hosts File:
1. Open **Notepad** as Administrator.
2. Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.
3. Add the lines above to the end of the file.
4. Save the file.

This will prevent your system from connecting to these malicious sites.
